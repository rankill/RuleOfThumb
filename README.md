## Description

For the development of the prototype the following tech stack was selected:

- **Angular 8**
¬†¬†¬†- **[In Memory Web Api](https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api "In Memory Web Api")**, An in-memory web api for Angular demos and tests that emulates CRUD operations over a RESTy API.

¬†¬†- IndexedDB to persist the votes made and obtain them after reloading the page

- **Sass**, Preprocessor to implement CSS in a structural and optimal way, for future growth the 7-1 pattern of Sass is proposed

- **Karma / Jasmine**

###Layout - Responsive

Mobile-first strategy was used for responsive implementation to generate a scalable architecture at the design level

### Architecture

The architecture in general allows to maintain and scale the project in a simple way, dividing this into three main folders:
¬†- **Shell**: Main component where the header and footer are rendered and any component that you want to keep throughout the navigation

- **Shared**: It will contain all the elements shared by the different modules of the platform, such as components, services, policies, etc.

- **Modules**: They are the main modules (Pages) of the platform


# Project Setup

### Install

```sh
npm install
```

### Usage

```sh
npm run start
```

### Run tests

To carry out the unit tests, **Jasmine** was used as a practice to perform BDD and **Karma** as a test runner. Unit tests were carried out for the main modules, generating in total:  **24** specs.

```sh
npm run test
```
